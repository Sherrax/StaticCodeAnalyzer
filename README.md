# Static Code Analyzer

The **Static Code Analyzer** is a Python tool designed to enforce coding standards and best practices in Python code. It analyzes Python files to detect common issues that violate established coding conventions, primarily focusing on PEP 8 guidelines and other best practices.

## Overview

Static code analysis is a crucial step in maintaining code quality. It allows developers to catch errors and enforce coding standards before the code is executed. This analyzer is built to help developers ensure their code is clean, readable, and maintainable by automatically checking for potential issues in their Python scripts.

## Features

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: The analyzer checks for adherence to PEP 8 style guidelines, ensuring consistent formatting across Python code.
- **Naming Conventions**: It verifies that variable and function names are in snake_case, while class names are in CamelCase, promoting clarity and uniformity.
- **Indentation Checks**: The tool enforces correct indentation practices, ensuring that the code is easily readable and free of indentation-related errors.
- **Error Reporting**: The analyzer outputs detailed messages for each detected issue, including the file path, line number, and a description of the problem.
- **Support for Multiple Files**: It can analyze single files or entire directories, making it versatile for different coding projects.

## Installation

To install the Static Code Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Install required dependencies, if any:

pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
To use the Static Code Analyzer, run the following command in your terminal, specifying the path to the Python file or directory you want to analyze:

Analyzing a Single File

python code_analyzer.py path/to/your_file.py
Analyzing All Python Files in a Directory


python code_analyzer.py path/to/your_directory
Upon execution, the analyzer will scan the specified file or directory, outputting any coding issues it finds.

## Code Checks
The analyzer identifies several types of issues, each labeled with a unique code for easy reference. Key checks include:

S001: Line too long (exceeds 79 characters).
S002: Indentation not a multiple of four spaces.
S003: Unnecessary semicolon at the end of a statement.
S004: Less than two spaces before inline comments.
S005: TODO comments present.
S006: More than two blank lines before a code line.
S007: Excess spaces after function or class definitions.
S008: Class names should be in CamelCase.
S009: Function names should be in snake_case.
S010: Argument names should be in snake_case.
S011: Variable names should be in snake_case.
S012: Mutable default arguments detected.
